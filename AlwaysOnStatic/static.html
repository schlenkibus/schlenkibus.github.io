				<h1>Always On Static - COOP Multiplayer Experience</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
        Always on Static is a coop multiplayer game for two, made out of two seperate games that affect each other and made with two different engines.<br><br>

        The near future: After a devastating game publisher apocalypse, the only way to play any videogame is by signing up to the only
        remaining subscription game service: IA-MICRO. Because you can't afford it, you hack the system with the help of your cousin Bob! <br><br>

        While you are playing your favorite Jump n' Run on your TV, cousin Bob keeps on running on your roof with an
        adjustable satellite dish and tries to catch the right signal. If he doesn't keep up, your TV screen
        turns into static noise until you can't see your game anymore. Only the collaborative effort can save you! <br><br>

        While playing, send Bob the right signal to switch to. Bob has to always keep up to your messages and adjust the
        dish acordingly. It gets pretty confusing, but if you succeed, you can get rid of the noise and beat the games highscore!
